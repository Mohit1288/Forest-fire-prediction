#Alegerian-Forest-fire-prediction

# Introduction

Forest fires pose a significant global challenge, resulting in the annual loss of millions of hectares. Algeria, like many nations, grapples with this issue, particularly during the summer season.Forest fire detection and forecasting become critical issues for reducing the disaster's damage. Exploration of new fire detection and forecast systems as alternatives to existing ones becomes a necessity. The goal is to predict whether or not the fire will break out based on weather data.
